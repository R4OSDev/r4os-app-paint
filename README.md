# PAINT.R4X

`PAINT.R4X` is an independent R4OS application implemented in Zig.

## Package

- Version: `0.1.5`
- Image target: `/R4OS/SOFTWARE/DESKTOP/PAINT.R4X`
- Image scope: `full`
- Canonical project manifest: `module.R4MF`

The manifest is the single source of truth for the artifact, imports, image
target, and package metadata.

## Build

On Windows:

    Build.bat

On Linux or macOS:

    ./Build.sh

The build starters resolve the current local R4OS dependency checkouts through
`Settings.R4S`. The URL and hash entries in `build.zig.zon` record the
last verified standalone dependency identities; workspace builds use the
mapped local checkouts.

## Documentation

Detailed German technical notes from the migration are preserved in
`DOCUMENTATION.de.txt`. Source-transfer provenance is recorded in
`PROVENANCE.txt`.

Document saving (0.78.69)
--------------------------
Notepad 0.1.11 and Paint 0.1.7 share the SDK document_save.Saver policy.
Save and Save As first create a private 8.3 sibling (DSxxxxxx.TMP), write
bounded chunks and confirm the final stream flush. Only then does the
existing Files.replaceAtomic facade publish the target. An old document is
never passed to fileWrite. Path, Dirty and recent-file history change only
after confirmed replacement. A truncated Notepad load also requires the
target to remain absent at the atomic publication boundary.

A failure before replacement aborts only the exact owned stream. An
unconfirmed replacement retains the stage and backup for recovery, while
the app keeps its edited document. A confirmed save with failed backup
cleanup stays successful and reports the retained backup. The temporary
names remain in the target directory; there is no direct-write fallback.
Existing FAT long names can be replaced, but creation of a new FAT long
name is not supported by the current atomic storage primitive. Such a
request fails without falling back to an unsafe overwrite.

One host case injects a single short stage write and checks unchanged
Notepad text, selection, path, Dirty and pending history, no replacement,
and cleanup of the owned stage. One short SMP4 console probe calls the real
Notepad methods on private FAT files and the real Paint methods on private
NTFS files: Save and Save As over existing targets, exact saved bytes,
metadata and sibling cleanup. It also confirms fresh Save As of a Notepad
prefix through the create-only atomic path. Both product modules build.
